# Assignment for analysis of possible ways to find out to reach the upper stair
There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top.
Consider the example shown in the diagram. The value of a is 3. There are 3 ways to reach the top.
For example, if a is 4, the person can climb 1 stair or 2 stairs or 3 stairs or 4 stairs at a time.

 if INPUT is a=1
 then OUTPUT = 1.
 if INPUT is a=2
 then OUTPUT=2
 and two ways are possible they are: (1,1) & (2).
 if INPUT a=3
 then OUTPUT = 4
 and there are Four possible ways they are: (1,1,1) (1,2) (2,1) & (3).
 Based on the number of stairs the possibilities are occur.
